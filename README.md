This project aims to replicate and enhance the findings of Fong and Motani's paper, "Symbolic Regression Enhanced Decision Trees for Classification Tasks," which introduces Symbolic Regression-Enhanced Decision Trees (SREDT). The method integrates symbolic regression with decision trees to generate more compact and efficient models for classifying diabetes patients.

Our project hopes to:
1. **Improve Accuracy:** The primary goal is to test the accuracy of the F-scores found on the diabetes dataset and enhance them by training different models and comparing them against SREDT.
2. **Identify Key Predictors:** We seek to identify key predictors and features commonly found in diabetes patients to predict potential diabetes diagnoses accurately.
